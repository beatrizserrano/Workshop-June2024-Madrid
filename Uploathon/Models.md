# BioImage Model Zoo Uploathon

## Overview

The BioImage Model Zoo Uploathon is an event aimed at bringing together experts and non-experts to upload models to the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io). Participants will engage in activities such as uploading their trained models, converting popular community models, and fine-tuning existing models. The goal is to increase the number of available models in the BioImage Model Zoo and to evaluate the process of model uploading, conversion, and fine-tuning.

## Model Categories
> Add the type of data you think it's useful to have here gathered such as the dataset it was trained on or something similar.

### 1. Models from Participants

These are models that participants, particularly those from the Human Technopole in Milan, have trained themselves.

#### Custom Models

- **Ashesh's Model(s)**
  - **Description:** Custom model for microscopic image splitting.
  - **Trained By:** Ashesh (PhD Student)
  - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)
  
- **Nuno's Model**
  - **Description:** Custom model.
  - **Trained By:** Nuno (Recent PhD Student)
  - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)

#### OpenCall Models
- **Model 1: Cellpose**
    - **Description:** Cellpose model from the first OpenCall.
    - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)
- **Model 2: Cellpose**
    - **Description:** Cellpose model from the first OpenCall.
    - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)
- **Model 3: Detectron**
    - **Description:** Detectron model from the first OpenCall.
    - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)

### 2. Community Interest Models

These are models identified as beneficial for the community but require additional effort to upload due to metadata and format requirements.

- **CellPose Models**
  - **Description:** Pre-trained Cellpose models popular in the community.
  - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)
  
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**
  - **Description:** SAM model conversion being worked on by Constantine.
  - **Meta-data:** (To be filled)

### 3. Fine-tuned Models

These models will be fine-tuned by non-experts during the event, using tools like ZeroCostDL4Mic notebooks. A competition will be held to determine the best models to upload based on performance and user experience.

- **Model Fine-tuning Process**
  - **Description:** Participants will download, fine-tune, and export models.
  - **Data:** (To be filled)
  - **Performance Metrics:** (To be filled)
